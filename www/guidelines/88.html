 Diagnostic Considerations
</h3>
<p>
 Darkfield examinations and tests to detect
 <i>
  T. pallidum
 </i>
 in lesion exudate or tissue are the definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis (197). Although no
 <i>
  T. pallidum
 </i>
 detection tests are commercially available, some laboratories provide locally developed PCR tests for the detection of
 <i>
  T. pallidum
 </i>
 . A presumptive diagnosis of syphilis is possible with the use of two types of serologic tests: 1) nontreponemal tests (e.g., Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] and RPR) and 2) treponemal tests (e.g., fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed [FTA-ABS] tests, the
 <i>
  T. pallidum
 </i>
 passive particle agglutination [TP-PA] assay, various EIAs, and chemiluminescence immunoassays). The use of only one type of serologic test is insufficient for diagnosis, because each type of test has limitations, including the possibility of false-positive test results in persons without syphilis. False-positive nontreponemal test results can be associated with various medical conditions unrelated to syphilis, including autoimmune conditions, older age, and injection-drug use (198,199); therefore, persons with a reactive nontreponemal test should receive a treponemal test to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis.
</p>
<p>
 Nontreponemal test antibody titers may correlate with disease activity, and results should be reported quantitatively. A fourfold change in titer, equivalent to a change of two dilutions (e.g., from 1:16 to 1:4 or from 1:8 to 1:32), is considered necessary to demonstrate a clinically significant difference between two nontreponemal test results that were obtained using the same serologic test. Sequential serologic tests in individual patients should be performed using the same testing method (e.g., VDRL or RPR), preferably by the same laboratory. The VDRL and RPR are equally valid assays, but quantitative results from the two tests cannot be compared directly because RPR titers frequently are slightly higher than&nbsp;VDRL titers. Nontreponemal test titers usually decline after treatment and might become nonreactive with time; however, in some persons, nontreponemal antibodies can persist for a long period of time &mdash; a response referred to as the &ldquo;serofast reaction.&rdquo; Most patients who have reactive treponemal tests will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless of treatment or disease activity. However, 15%&ndash;25% of patients treated during the primary stage revert to being serologically nonreactive after 2&ndash;3 years (200). Treponemal test antibody titers should not be used to assess treatment response.
</p>
<p>
 Some clinical laboratories and blood banks have begun to screen samples using treponemal tests, typically by EIA or chemiluminescence immunoassays (201,202). This strategy will identify both persons with previous treatment for syphilis and persons with untreated or incompletely treated syphilis. The positive predictive value for syphilis associated with a treponemal screening test result might be lower among populations with a low prevalence of syphilis.
</p>
<p>
 Persons with a positive treponemal screening test should have a standard nontreponemal test with titer performed reflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management decisions. If the nontreponemal test is negative, then the laboratory should perform a different treponemal test (preferably one based on different antigens than the original test) to confirm the results of the initial test. If a second treponemal test is positive, persons with a history of previous treatment will require no further management unless sexual history suggests likelihood of re-exposure. Those without a history of treatment for syphilis should be offered treatment. Unless history or results of a physical examination suggest a recent infection, previously untreated persons should be treated for late latent syphilis. If the second treponemal test is negative, further evaluation or treatment is not indicated.
</p>
<p>
 For most HIV-infected persons, serologic tests are accurate and reliable for the diagnosis of syphilis and for following a patient&rsquo;s response to treatment. However, atypical syphilis serologic test results (i.e., unusually high, unusually low, or fluctuating titers) can occur in HIV-infected persons. When serologic tests do not correspond with clinical findings suggestive of early syphilis, use of other tests (e.g., biopsy and darkfield microscopy) should be considered.
</p>
<p>
 Clinical signs of neurosyphilis (i.e., cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental status, loss of vibration sense, and auditory or ophthalmic abnormalities) warrant further investigation and treatment for neurosyphilis. Laboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of neurosyphilis; however, no single test can be used to diagnose neurosyphilis in all instances. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory abnormalities are common in persons with early syphilis. The VDRL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-VDRL),&nbsp;which is highly specific but insensitive, is the standard serologic test for CSF. When reactive in the absence of substantial contamination of CSF with blood, it is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis; however in early syphilis, it can be of unknown prognostic significance (203). Most other tests are both insensitive and nonspecific and must be interpreted in relation to other test results and the clinical assessment. Therefore, the laboratory diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on various combinations of reactive serologic test results, CSF cell count or protein, and a reactive CSF-VDRL with or without clinical manifestations. Among persons with HIV infection, the CSF leukocyte count usually is elevated (&gt;5 white blood cell count [WBC]/mm3); using a higher cutoff (&gt;20 WBC/ mm3) might improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis (204). The CSF-VDRL might be nonreactive even when neurosyphilis is present; therefore, additional evaluation using FTA-ABS testing on CSF can be considered. The CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly sensitive; neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS test (205).
