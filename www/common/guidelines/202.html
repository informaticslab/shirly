 Chlamydial Infections in Adolescents and Adults
</h2>
<p>
 Chlamydial genital infection is the most frequently reported infectious disease in the United States, and prevalence is highest in persons aged &le;25 years (93). Several important sequelae can result from
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 infection in women, the most serious of which include PID, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Some women who have uncomplicated cervical infection already have subclinical upper-reproductive&ndash;tract infection upon diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
 Asymptomatic infection is common among both men and women. To detect chlamydial infections, health-care providers frequently rely on screening tests. Annual screening of all sexually active women aged &le;25 years is recommended, as is screening of older women with risk factors (e.g., those who have a new sex partner or multiple sex partners). In June 2007, USPSTF reviewed and updated their chlamydia screening guidance and found that the epidemiology of chlamydial&nbsp;infection in the United States had not changed since the last review (81,271). In issuing recommendations, USPSTF made the decision to alter the age groups used to demonstrate disease incidence (i.e., from persons aged &le;25 years to those aged &le;24 years). CDC has not changed its age cutoff, and thus continues to recommend annual chlamydia screening of sexually active women aged &le;25 years.
</p>
<p>
 Screening programs have been demonstrated to reduce both the prevalence of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 infection and rates of PID in women (272,273). Although evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 in sexually active young men because of several factors (including feasibility, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness) (94), the screening of sexually active young men should be considered in clinical settings with a high prevalence of chlamydia (e.g., adolescent clinics, correctional facilities, and STD clinics). Among women, the primary focus of chlamydia screening efforts should be to detect chlamydia and prevent complications, whereas targeted chlamydia screening in men should only be considered when resources permit and do not hinder chlamydia screening efforts in women (274 275). An appropriate sexual risk assessment should be conducted for all persons and might indicate more frequent screening for some women or certain men (see MSM).
