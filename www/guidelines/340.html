 Counseling Messages for Women Receiving Cervical Cancer Screening and HPV Testing
</h2>
<p>
 When a woman receives abnormal cervical cytology test results, she might experience considerable anxiety, distress, fear, and confusion, which can serve as barriers to follow-up care. Furthermore, a positive HPV DNA test result might exacerbate these feelings and might also elicit partner concerns, worry about disclosure, and feelings of guilt, anger, and stigmatization.
</p>
<p>
 Health-care providers are the most trusted source of information&nbsp;about HPV and abnormal cervical cytology test results. Therefore, they have an important role to play in educating women about high-risk HPV and moderating the psychosocial impact of the diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
 STD clinic providers should offer patients counseling and information both verbally and in print when delivering HPV and Pap test results. Print materials are available at several websites (
 <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/common/" rel="external" target="_blank">
  http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/common/
 </a>
 ;
 <a href="http://www.ashastd.org/hpv/hpv_publications.cfm" rel="external" target="_blank">
  http://www.ashastd.org/hpv/hpv_publications.cfm
 </a>
 ). The manner in which this information is communicated to patients can influence the psychological effect of this diagnosis, as well as a woman&rsquo;s likelihood of following up with necessary testing or treatment. Providers should frame high-risk HPV in a neutral, nonstigmatizing&nbsp;context and emphasize its common, asymptomatic, and transient nature. Also, the provider should emphasize that&nbsp;HPV is often shared between partners and can lie dormant for many years; having HPV does not imply infidelity, nor should it necessarily raise concerns about a partner&rsquo;s health.
</p>
<p>
 In counseling women with high-risk HPV infections about partner management, messages should be tailored to the individual&nbsp;woman&rsquo;s circumstances. While no evidence supports either partner notification (PN) or clinical-evaluation referral for partners of patients with high-risk HPV, some women might benefit from having an informed discussion about their diagnosis with their partners. This type of communication can foster partner support and ensure the sharing of information that can inform decision-making (e.g., decisions regarding condom use).
</p>
<p>
 The following specific key messages should be communicated&nbsp;to patients receiving cervical screening:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; The purpose of regular, lifelong cervical cancer screening is to identify cervical cancer precursors, which can be treated before progression to cervical cancer.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; A positive high-risk HPV DNA test or an abnormal cervical cytology test is not indicative of cervical cancer. Appropriate follow-up is necessary to ensure that cervical abnormalities do not progress.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Some women might have a normal Pap test and a positive&nbsp;high-risk HPV test. A positive high risk HPV DNA test indicates a HPV infection of the cervix, but does not indicate cervical cancer. A normal cervical cytology test indicates that no cellular abnormalities were detected at the time of testing, but women who have HPV infection of the cervix have a higher likelihood of developing cell changes, which could lead to cervical cancer over time. Follow-up evaluation is essential to monitor cervical cytology.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; A Pap test that reveals ASC-US indicates some abnormal areas on the cervix that may require close follow-up or treatment so that they do not progress. Additional testing might be required to confirm these results. It is essential that patients return for all follow-up appointments and recommended tests.
</p>
<p>
 Discussion concerning disclosure of a positive high-risk HPV test to sex partners might be appropriate and can include the following information:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; HPV is very common. It can infect the genital areas of both men and women. It usually has no signs or symptoms.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Most sexually active persons get HPV at some time in their lives, though most will never know it. Even persons with only one lifetime sex partner can get HPV if their partner was infected.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; While the immune system clears HPV infection most of the time, in some persons, HPV infection does not resolve.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; No clinically validated test exists for men to determine if they have HPV infection. The most common manifestation&nbsp;of HPV infection in men is genital warts. High-risk HPV types seldom cause genital warts.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Partners who are in a long-term relationship tend to share HPV. Sexual partners of HPV-infected patients also likely have HPV, even though they might have no signs or symptoms of infection.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Detection of high-risk HPV infection in a woman does not mean that the woman or her partner is engaging in sexual activity outside of a relationship. HPV infection can be present for many years before it is detected, and no method can accurately confirm when HPV infection was acquired.
</p>
<p>
 Prevention measures for current and subsequent sex partners&nbsp;and risk reduction should be discussed. Providers should counsel women about condom use depending on their current&nbsp;circumstances. Consistent condom use by male partners of sexually active women can reduce the risk for cervical and vulvovaginal HPV infection (25), and condom use by couples in long-term partnerships might decrease the time required to clear HPV in the infected woman. Skin not covered by a condom remains vulnerable to HPV infection. HPV vaccines are available and recommended for girls and young women aged 9&ndash;26 years, even those who have been diagnosed with HPV infection. Male partners can be vaccinated with the quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil) to prevent genital warts.
