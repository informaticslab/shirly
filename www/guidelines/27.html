 Other Concerns
</h3>
<p>
 &bull; Pregnant women who are HBsAg positive should be reported to the local or state health department to ensure that they are entered into a case management system and that timely and appropriate prophylaxis is provided for their infants. Information concerning the pregnant woman&rsquo;s HBsAg status should be provided to the hospital in which delivery is planned and to the health-care provider who will care for the newborn. In addition, household and sex contacts of women who are HBsAg positive should be vaccinated.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Women who are HBsAg positive should be provided with, or referred for, appropriate counseling and medical management. Pregnant women who are HBsAg positive should receive information regarding hepatitis B that addresses:
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; modes of transmission;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; perinatal concerns (e.g., breastfeeding is not&nbsp;contraindicated);&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; prevention of HBV transmission, including the&nbsp;importance of postexposure prophylaxis for the newborn infant and hepatitis B vaccination for household contacts and sex partners; and
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; evaluation for and treatment of chronic HBV infection.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; No treatment is available for pregnant women infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, all women with HCV infection should receive appropriate counseling and supportive care as needed (see Hepatitis C, Prevention). No vaccine is available to prevent HCV transmission.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; In the absence of lesions during the third trimester, routine serial cultures for herpes simplex virus (HSV) are not indicated for women who have a history of recurrent genital herpes. Prophylactic cesarean delivery is not indicated for women who do not have active genital lesions at the time of delivery.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; The presence of genital warts is not an indication for cesarean delivery.
</p>
<p>

<p>
 Recommendations to screen pregnant women for STDs are based on disease severity and sequelae, prevalence in the population, costs, medicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors. The screening recommendations in this report are generally broader (i.e., if followed, more women will be screened for more STDs than would by following other screening recommendations) and are also consistent with other CDC guidelines.
