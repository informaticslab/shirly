 Evaluation and Treatment of Infants During the First Month of Life
</h3>
<p>
 The diagnosis of congenital syphilis is complicated by the transplacental transfer of maternal nontreponemal and treponemal IgG antibodies to the fetus, which can complicate the interpretation of reactive serologic tests for syphilis in infants. Therefore, treatment decisions frequently must be made on the basis of 1) identification of syphilis in the mother; 2) adequacy of maternal treatment; 3) presence of clinical, laboratory, or radiographic evidence of syphilis in the infant; and 4) comparison of maternal (at delivery) and infant&nbsp;nontreponemal serologic titers using the same test conducted preferably by the same laboratory.
</p>
<p>
 All infants born to mothers who have reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal serologic test (RPR or VDRL) performed on infant serum, because umbilical cord blood can become contaminated with maternal blood and yield a false- positive result. Conducting a treponemal test (i.e., TP-PA, FTA-ABS, EIA, or chemiluminescence assay) on a newborn&rsquo;s serum is not necessary. No commercially available immunoglobulin (IgM) test can be recommended.
</p>
<p>
 All infants born to women who have reactive serologic tests for syphilis should be examined thoroughly for evidence of congenital syphilis (e.g., nonimmune hydrops, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, rhinitis, skin rash, and pseudoparalysis of an extremity). Pathologic examination of the placenta or umbilical cord using specific fluorescent antitreponemal antibody staining is suggested. Darkfield microscopic examination of suspicious lesions or body fluids (e.g., nasal discharge) also should be performed.
</p>
<p>
 The following scenarios describe the evaluation and treatment of infants for congenital syphilis.
</p>
<h4 id="sigil_toc_id_158">
 Scenario 1
</h4>
<p>
 Infants with proven or highly probable disease and&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 1. an abnormal physical examination that is consistent with&nbsp;congenital syphilis;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 2. a serum quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer that&nbsp;is fourfold higher than the mother&rsquo;s titer;&para; or&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 3. a positive darkfield test of body fluid(s).
</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_159">
 Recommended Evaluation
</h5>
<p>
 &bull; CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein**&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Complete blood count (CBC) and differential and platelet count&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Other tests as clinically indicated (e.g., long-bone radiographs, chest radiograph, liver-function tests, cranial ultrasound, ophthalmologic examination, and auditory brain stem response)
</p>
<p>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 If more than 1 day of therapy is missed, the entire course should be restarted. Data are insufficient regarding the use of other antimicrobial agents (e.g., ampicillin). When possible, a full 10-day course of penicillin is preferred, even if ampicillin was initially provided for possible sepsis. The use of agents other than penicillin requires close serologic follow-up to assess adequacy of therapy. In all other situations, the maternal history of infection with
 <i>
  T. pallidum
 </i>
 and treatment for syphilis must be considered when evaluating and treating the infant.
</p>
<h4 id="sigil_toc_id_160">
 Scenario 2
</h4>
<p>
 Infants who have a normal physical examination and a serum quantitive nontreponemal serologic titer the same or less than fourfold the maternal titer and the
</p>
<p>
 1. mother was not treated, inadequately treated, or has no documentation of having received treatment;
</p>
<p>
 2. mother was treated with erythromycin or another non- penicillin regimen;&dagger;&dagger; or
</p>
<p>
 3. mother received treatment &lt;4 weeks before delivery.
</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_161">
 Recommended Evaluation
</h5>
<p>
 &bull; CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; CBC, differential, and platelet count&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Long-bone radiographs&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 A complete evaluation is not necessary if 10 days of parenteral therapy is administered, although such evaluations might be useful. For instance, a lumbar puncture might document CSF abnormalities that would prompt close follow-up. Other tests (e.g., CBC, platelet count, and bone radiographs) can be performed to further support a diagnosis of congenital syphilis. If a single dose of benzathine penicillin G is used, then the infant must be fully evaluated (i.e., by CSF examination, long-bone radiographs, and CBC with platelets), the full evaluation must be normal, and follow-up must be certain. If any part of the infant&rsquo;s evaluation is abnormal or not performed or if the CSF analysis is rendered uninterpretable because of contamination with blood, then a 10-day course of penicillin is required.&sect;&sect;
</p>
<p>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 If the mother has untreated early syphilis at delivery, 10 days of parenteral therapy can be considered.
