 Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy
</h1>
<p>
 No proven alternatives to penicillin are available for treating neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis in pregnant women. Penicillin also is recommended for use, whenever possible, in HIV-infected patients. Of the adult U.S. population, 3%&ndash;10% have experienced an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic response to penicillin (238,239), such as urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis (i.e., upper airway obstruction, bronchospasm, or hypotension). Readministration of penicillin to these patients can cause severe, immediate reactions. Because anaphylactic reactions to penicillin can be fatal, every effort should be made to avoid administering penicillin to penicillin-allergic patients, unless they undergo acute desensitization to eliminate anaphylactic sensitivity.
</p>
<p>
 Although an estimated 10% of persons who report a history of severe allergic reactions to penicillin continue to remain&nbsp;allergic their entire lives, with the passage of time, most persons who have had a severe reaction to penicillin stop expressing penicillin-specific IgE (238,239). These persons can then be treated safely with penicillin. Penicillin skin testing with the major and minor determinants of penicillin can reliably identify persons at high risk for penicillin reactions (238,239). Although these reagents are easily generated and have been available for more than 30 years, only benzylpenicilloyl poly-L-lysine (Pre-Pen [i.e., the major determinant]) and penicillin G have been available commercially. These two tests identify an estimated 90%&ndash;97% of the currently allergic patients. However, because skin testing without the minor determinants would still miss 3%&ndash;10% of allergic patients and because serious or fatal reactions can occur among these minor-determinant&ndash;positive patients, caution should be exercised when the full battery of skin-test reagents is not available (Box 2). Manufacturers are working to ensure better availability of the Pre-Pen skin test reagent as well as an accompanying minor determinant mixture.
