 Prevention
</h2>
<p>
 No vaccine for hepatitis C is available, and prophylaxis with immune globulin is not effective in preventing HCV infection after exposure. Reducing the burden of HCV infection&nbsp;and disease in the United States requires implementation of both primary and secondary prevention activities. Primary prevention reduces or eliminates HCV transmission, whereas secondary prevention activities are aimed at reducing CLD and other chronic diseases in HCV-infected persons by first identifying them and then providing medical management and antiviral therapy, if appropriate.
</p>
<p>
 Most scientific evidence demonstrates that although HCV can be transmitted sexually, such transmission happens rarely. Because incident HCV has not been demonstrated to occur in heterosexual partner-pairs followed over time (452&ndash;454), condom use might not be necessary in such circumstances. However, heterosexual and homosexual persons, especially those with concurrent HIV infection or with more than one partner, should protect themselves and their partners against transmission of HCV, HBV, HIV, and other pathogens by use of male latex condoms. Condom use is especially important for HIV-infected men, who might spread HCV to other men though unprotected sexual activity (464&ndash;466).
</p>
<p>
 Providers in STD clinics and other primary-care settings should identify those persons who should be offered HCV counseling and testing. In STD clinics and other settings that serve large numbers of persons at high risk for bloodborne infections (e.g., correctional settings), the major risk factor necessitating screening for HCV infection is past or current injection of illegal drugs. Because both HCV and HIV are transmitted through injection-drug use, about one fourth of all HIV patients are also coinfected with HCV. For this reason, all persons with HIV infection should be offered HCV counseling and testing. Other risk factors for which routine HCV testing is recommended include:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; having had a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant before July 1992;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; having received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; having been on long-term dialysis; and
</p>
<p>
 &bull; having signs and symptoms of liver disease (e.g., abnormal&nbsp;ALT).
</p>
<p>
 Persons who test negative for anti-HCV who had an exposure&nbsp;previously should be reassured that they are not infected. Those who test positive for anti-HCV (see Diagnosis and Treatment) should be provided information regarding how to protect their liver from further harm; for instance, HCV-positive persons should be advised to avoid drinking alcohol and taking any new medicines (including OTC and herbals) without checking with their clinician.
</p>
<p>
 To reduce the risk for transmission to others, HCV-positive persons should be advised to 1) not donate blood, body organs, other tissue, or semen; 2) not share any personal items that might have blood on them (e.g., toothbrushes and razors); and 3) cover cuts and sores on the skin to keep the virus from spreading by blood or secretions. HCV-positive persons with one long-term, steady sex partner do not need to change their sexual practices. They should discuss the low but present risk for transmission with their partner and discuss the need for counseling and testing. HCV-positive women do not need to avoid pregnancy or breastfeeding.
</p>
<p>
 HCV-positive persons should be evaluated (by referral or consultation, if appropriate) to detect active HCV infection and the presence of CLD. Evaluation should involve testing for liver function, additional assessment of the severity of liver&nbsp;disease, possible treatment, and the determination for the need of hepatitis A and B vaccination.
</p>
<p>
 Regardless of test results, persons who use or inject illegal drugs should be counseled to stop using and injecting drugs and to enter and complete substance abuse treatment (including&nbsp;relapse prevention). Persons who continue to inject drugs despite counseling should be encouraged to take the following steps to reduce personal and public health risks:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; never reuse or share syringes, water, or drug preparation equipment;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; only use syringes obtained from a reliable source (e.g., pharmacies);
</p>
<p>
 &bull; use a new, sterile syringe to prepare and inject drugs;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; if possible, use sterile water to prepare drugs; otherwise, use clean water from a reliable source (e.g., fresh tap water);
</p>
<p>
 &bull; use a new or disinfected container (i.e., cooker) and a new filter (i.e., cotton) to prepare drugs;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; clean the injection site before injection with a new alcohol swab;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; safely dispose of syringes after one use;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B if nonimmune; and
</p>
<p>
 &bull; get tested for HIV infection.
