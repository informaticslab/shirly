 Trichomoniasis
</h2>
<p>
 Trichomoniasis is caused by the protozoan
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 . Some men who are infected with
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 might not have symptoms; others have NGU. Some women have symptoms characterized by a diffuse, malodorous, yellow-green vaginal discharge with vulvar irritation. However, many women have minimal or no symptoms. Because of the high prevalence of trichomoniasis in clinical and nonclinical settings (64,92,353,354), testing for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 should be performed in women seeking care for vaginal discharge. Screening for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 in women can be considered in those at high risk for infection (i.e., women who have new or multiple partners, have a history of STDs, exchange sex for payment, and use injection drugs).
</p>
<p>
 Diagnosis of vaginal trichomoniasis is usually performed by microscopy of vaginal secretions, but this method has a&nbsp;sensitivity of only approximately 60%&ndash;70% and requires immediate evaluation of wet preparation slide for optimal results. FDA-cleared tests for trichomoniasis in women include OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test (Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, Massachusetts), an immunochromatographic capillary flow dipstick technology, and the Affirm VP III (Becton Dickenson, San Jose, California), a nucleic acid probe test that evaluates for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  G. vaginalis
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  C. albicans
 </i>
 . Each of these tests, which are performed on vaginal secretions, have a sensitivity of &gt;83% and a specificity of &gt;97%. Both tests are considered point-of-care diagnostics. The results of the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test are available in approximately&nbsp;10 minutes, whereas results of the Affirm VP III are available within 45 minutes. Although these tests tend to be more sensitive than those requiring vaginal wet preparation, false positives might occur, especially in populations with a low prevalence of disease.
</p>
<p>
 Culture is another sensitive and highly specific commercially&nbsp;available method of diagnosis. Among women in whom trichomoniasis is suspected but not confirmed by microscopy, vaginal secretions should be cultured for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 . While the sensitivity of a Pap test for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 diagnosis is poor, use of a liquid-based testing has demonstrated enhanced sensitivity; however, false-positive tests can occur, and confirmatory testing might be needed in some circumstances (355). An FDA-cleared PCR assay for detection of gonorrhea and chlamydial infection&nbsp;(Amplicor, manufactured by Roche Diagnostic Corp.) has been modified for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 detection in vaginal or endocervical swabs and in urine from women and men; sensitivity&nbsp;ranges from 88%&ndash;97% and specificity from 98%&ndash;99% (356). APTIMA
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 Analyte Specific Reagents (ASR; manufactured by Gen-Probe, Inc.) also can detect
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 RNA by transcription-mediated amplification using the same instrumentation platforms available for the FDA-cleared APTIMA Combo2 assay for diagnosis of gonorrhea and chlamydial&nbsp;infection; published validation studies of
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 ASR found sensitivity ranging from 74%&ndash;98% and specificity of 87%&ndash;98% (357&ndash;359). Laboratories that use the Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo2 test for detection of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 can consider adding the
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 ASR to their testing armentarium, as long as the necessary CLIA verification studies have been conducted.
</p>
<p>
 In men, wet preparation is not a sensitive test, and no approved point-of-care tests are available. Culture testing of urethral swab, urine, or semen is one diagnostic option; however, NAATs (i.e., PCR or transcription-mediated amplification&nbsp;[TMA]) have superior sensitivity for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 diagnosis in men (356,359).
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 has not been found to infect oral sites, and rectal prevalence appears low in MSM&nbsp;(360). Therefore, oral and rectal testing for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 is not recommended.
</p>
<p>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 The nitroimidazoles comprise the only class of drugs useful&nbsp;for the oral or parenteral therapy of trichomoniasis. Of these drugs, metronidazole and tinidazole are available in the United States and are cleared by the FDA for the treatment of trichomoniasis. In randomized clinical trials, the recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately&nbsp;90%&ndash;95%, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 86%&ndash;100%. The appropriate treatment of sex partners might increase these reported rates. Randomized controlled trials comparing&nbsp;single 2-g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole suggest that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and resolution of symptoms (361). Treatment of patients and sex partners results in relief of symptoms,&nbsp;microbiologic cure, and reduction of transmission.
</p>
<p>
 Metronidazole gel is considerably less efficacious for the treatment of trichomoniasis (&lt;50%) than oral preparations of metronidazole. Topically applied antimicrobials (e.g., metronidazole&nbsp;gel) are unlikely to achieve therapeutic levels in the urethra or perivaginal glands; therefore, use of this gel is not recommended. Several other topically applied antimicrobials occasionally have been used for treatment of trichomoniasis; however, these preparations likely are no more effective than metronidazole gel.
