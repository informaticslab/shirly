 Prevention
</h3>
<p>
 Two products have been approved for hepatitis B prevention:&nbsp;hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine (3,4). HBIG provides temporary (i.e., 3&ndash;6 months) protection from HBV infection and is typically used as PEP either as an adjunct to hepatitis B vaccination in previously unvaccinated persons or alone in persons who have not responded to vaccination. HBIG is prepared from plasma known to contain high concentrations of anti-HBs. The recommended&nbsp;dose of HBIG is 0.06 mL/kg.
</p>
<p>
 Hepatitis B vaccine contains HBsAg produced in yeast by recombinant DNA technology and provides protection from HBV infection when used for both pre-exposure vaccination and PEP. The two available monovalent hepatitis B vaccines for use in adolescents and adults are Recombivax HB (Merck and Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) and Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). A combination vaccine (hepatitis A and hepatitis B) for use in&nbsp;adults, Twinrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), also is available. The recommended HBV dose varies by product and age of recipient (Table 3).
</p>
<p>
 When selecting a hepatitis B vaccination schedule, the health-care provider should consider the need to achieve completion of the vaccine series. Approved adolescent and adult schedules for both monovalent hepatitis B vaccine (i.e., Engerix-B and Recombivax HB) include the following: 0, 1, and 6 months; 0, 1, and 4 months; and 0, 2, and 4 months. A 4-dose schedule of Engerix-B at 0, 1, 2, and 12 months is licensed for all age groups. A 2-dose schedule of Recombivax HB adult formulation (10 &mu;g) is licensed for adolescents aged 11&ndash;15 years. When scheduled to receive the second dose, adolescents&nbsp;aged &gt;15 years should be switched to a 3-dose series, with doses two and three consisting of the pediatric formulation&nbsp;(5 &mu;g) administered on an appropriate schedule. Twinrix can be administered to persons aged &ge;18 years at risk for both HAV and HBV infections at 0, 1, and 6 months.
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered IM in the deltoid muscle and can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines. For adolescents and adults, the needle length should be 1&ndash;2 inches, depending on the recipient&rsquo;s weight (1 inch for females weighing &lt;70 kg, 1.5 inches for males weighing&nbsp;&lt;120 kg, and 2 inches for males and females weighing &gt;120 kg and &gt;100 kg, respectively). A 22- to 25-gauge needle is recommended. If the vaccine series is interrupted after the first or second dose of vaccine, the missed dose should be administered as soon as possible. The series does not need to be restarted after a missed dose.
</p>
<p>
 In adolescents and healthy adults aged &lt;40 years, approximately 30%&ndash;55% acquire a protective antibody response (anti-HBs &ge;10 mIU/mL) after the first vaccine dose, 75% after the second, and &gt;90% after the third. Vaccine-induced immune memory has been demonstrated to persist for at least 15&ndash;20 years. Periodic testing to determine antibody levels after routine vaccination in immunocompetent persons is not necessary, and booster doses of vaccine are not currently recommended.
</p>
<p>
 Hepatitis B vaccination is generally well-tolerated by most recipients. Pain at the injection site and low-grade fever are reported by a minority of recipients. For children and adolescents,&nbsp;a causal association exists between receipt of hepatitis B vaccination and anaphylaxis: for each 1.1 million doses of vaccine administered, approximately one vaccinee will experience&nbsp;this type of reaction. No deaths have been reported in these patients (3,4,447). Vaccine is contraindicated in persons with a history of anaphylaxis after a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine and in persons with a known anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine component. No evidence for a causal association has been demonstrated for other adverse events after administration&nbsp;of hepatitis B vaccine.
