 Genital Warts
</h1>
<p>
 Of genital warts, 90% are caused by HPV 6 or 11. HPV types 6 or 11 are commonly found before, or at the time of, detection of genital warts (406). HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 are found occasionally in visible genital warts (usually as coinfections with HPV 6 or 11) and can be associated with foci of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, particularly in persons who are infected with HIV infection. In addition to warts on genital areas, HPV types 6 and 11 have been associated with conjunctival, nasal, oral, and laryngeal warts.
</p>
<p>
 Genital warts are usually asymptomatic, but depending on the size and anatomic location, they can be painful or pruritic.&nbsp;Genital warts are usually flat, papular, or pedunculated growths on the genital mucosa. Genital warts occur commonly at certain anatomic sites, including around the introitus in women, under the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and on the shaft of the circumcised penis. Genital warts can also occur at multiple sites in the anogenital epithelium or within the anogenital tract (e.g., cervix, vagina, urethra, perineum, perianal skin, and scrotum). Intra-anal warts are observed predominantly&nbsp;in persons who have had receptive anal intercourse, but they can also occur in men and women who do not have a history of anal sexual contact.
</p>
<p>
 Diagnosis of genital warts is usually clinical, made by visual inspection. Genital warts can be confirmed by biopsy, which might be indicated if 1) the diagnosis is uncertain; 2) the lesions do not respond to standard therapy; 3) the disease worsens during therapy; 4) the lesion is atypical; 5) the patient has comprised immunity; or 6) the warts are pigmented, indurated, fixed, bleeding, or ulcerated. Genital warts are usually&nbsp;asymptomatic, but depending on the size and anatomic location, they might be painful or pruritic. The use of HPV DNA testing for genital wart diagnosis is not recommended, because test results would not alter clinical management of the condition.
</p>
<p>
 The application of 3%&ndash;5% acetic acid, which causes skin color to turn white, has been used by some providers to detect HPV-infected genital mucosa. However, acetic acid application is not a specific test for HPV infection. Therefore, the routine use of this procedure for screening to detect mucosal changes attributed to HPV infection is not recommended.
