 Screening Recommendations
</h2>
<p>
 STD clinics that provide routine cervical screening services should follow the available guidelines. However, to ensure the provision of adequate care, follow-up and referral sources must be in place. Cervical screening should be performed using either conventional or liquid-based cytologic tests (i.e., Pap tests) and can include HR-HPV DNA tests in specific circumstances (420). For cythopathologic and HPV/DNA&nbsp;testing, STD clinics should use CLIA certified laboratories (421) and those that report cytopathology findings according to the following Bethesda 2001 terminology (422): atypical squamous cells (ASC), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and high-grade intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). The ASC category is subdivided into atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and atypical squamous cells&mdash;cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H).
</p>
<p>
 During appointments in which a pelvic examination for STD screening is performed, the health-care provider should inquire about the result of the patient&rsquo;s most recent Pap test and discuss the following information with the patient:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; the purpose and importance of a Pap test;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; the need for regularly scheduled Pap tests between 21&ndash;65 years of age;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; whether a Pap test will be obtained during this clinic visit; and
</p>
<p>
 &bull; if a Pap test will not be obtained during this examination, the names of local providers or referral clinics that can perform Pap tests and adequately follow up results.
</p>
<p>
 If a woman has not had a Pap test during the previous 12 months (2-year intervals for women aged 21&ndash;29 years and 3-year intervals for women aged &ge;30 years with a history of three normal Pap tests) and cervical screening is indicated, a Pap test should be obtained as part of the routine pelvic examination. Health-care providers should be aware that many women frequently equate having a pelvic examination with having a Pap test; they erroneously believe that a sample for Pap testing was taken, when in reality, only a pelvic examination&nbsp;was performed. Because self-reports of Pap tests often are not accurate, STD clinics should have a protocol for conducting&nbsp;cervical cancer screening and obtaining a Pap test during the routine clinical evaluation of women who do not have clinical-record documentation of a normal Pap test within the preceding 12 months and do not have another provider for screening services.
