 Initial and 2-Week Follow-Up Examinations
</h4>
<p>
 During the initial examination and 2-week follow-up examination (if indicated), the following should be performed.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Visual inspection of the genital, perianal, and oral areas for genital discharge, odor, bleeding, irritation, warts, and ulcerative lesions. The clinical manifestations of some STDs are different in children than in adults. For example, typical vesicular lesions might not be present in the presence of HSV infection. Because this infection can be indicative of sexual abuse, specimens should be obtained from all vesicular or ulcerative genital or perianal&nbsp;lesions compatible with genital herpes and then sent for viral culture.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Specimen collection for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 culture from the pharynx and anus in boys and girls, the vagina in girls, and the urethra in boys. Cervical specimens are not recommended&nbsp;for prepubertal girls. For boys with a urethral discharge, a meatal specimen discharge is an adequate substitute for an intraurethral swab specimen. Because of the legal implications of a diagnosis of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 infection in a child, if culture for the isolation of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 is done, only standard culture procedures should be performed. Gram stains are inadequate to evaluate prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude gonorrhea. Specimens from the vagina, urethra, pharynx, or rectum should be streaked onto selective media for isolation of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 ,&nbsp;and all presumptive isolates of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 should be identified definitively by at least two tests that involve different principles (e.g., biochemical, enzyme substrate, or serologic). Isolates should be preserved to enable additional or repeated testing.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Cultures for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 from specimens collected from the anus in both boys and girls and from the vagina in girls. The likelihood of recovering
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 from the urethra of prepubertal boys is too low to justify the trauma involved in obtaining an intraurethral specimen.&nbsp;However, a meatal specimen should be obtained if urethral discharge is present. Pharyngeal specimens for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 are not recommended for children of either sex because the yield is low, perinatally acquired infection might persist beyond infancy, and culture systems&nbsp;in some laboratories do not distinguish between
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  C. pneumoniae
 </i>
 . Only standard culture systems for the isolation of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 should be used. The isolation of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 should be confirmed by microscopic identification of inclusions by staining with fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 ; EIAs are not acceptable confirmatory methods. Isolates should be preserved. Nonculture tests for chlamydia (e.g., nonamplified probes, EIAs, and DFA) are not sufficiently specific for use in circumstances involving possible child abuse or assault. NAATs can be used for detection of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 in vaginal specimens&nbsp;or urine from girls. All specimens should be retained for additional testing if necessary. No data are available regarding the use of NAATs in boys or for extragenital specimens (e.g., those obtained from the rectum) in boys and girls. Culture remains the preferred method for extragenital sites.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Culture and wet mount of a vaginal swab specimen for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 infection and BV.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Collection of serum samples to be evaluated immediately, preserved for subsequent analysis, and used as a baseline for comparison with follow-up serologic tests. Sera should be tested immediately for antibodies to sexually transmitted&nbsp;agents. Agents for which suitable tests are available include
 <i>
  T. pallidum
 </i>
 , HIV, and HBV. Decisions regarding the agents for which to perform serologic tests should be made on a case-by-case basis.
</p>
<p>
 Data on use of NAATs for detection of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 in children are limited, and performance is test dependent (197,486). Consultation with an expert is necessary before using NAATs in this context to minimize the possibility of cross-reaction with nongonococcal
 <i>
  Neisseria
 </i>
 species and other commensals (e.g.,
 <i>
  N. meningitidis
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  N. sicca
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  N. lactamica
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  N. cinerea
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  Moraxella
 </i>
 <i>
  catarrhalis
 </i>
 ). NAATs can be used as an alternative to culture with vaginal specimens or urine from girls, whereas culture remains the preferred method for urethral specimens or urine from boys and for extragenital specimens (pharynx and rectum) from all children. All positive specimens should be retained for additional testing.
</p>
<p>
 HIV infection has been reported in children whose only known risk factor was sexual abuse. Serologic testing for HIV infection should be considered for abused children. The decision&nbsp;to test for HIV infection should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the likelihood of infection among assailant(s). Although data are insufficient concerning the efficacy and safety of PEP among both children and adults, treatment is well tolerated by infants and children (with and without HIV infection), and children have a minimal risk for serious adverse reactions because of the short period recommended&nbsp;for prohylaxis. (78,138). In considering whether to offer antiretroviral PEP, health-care providers should consider whether the child can be treated soon after the sexual exposure&nbsp;(i.e., within 72 hours), the likelihood that the assailant is infected with HIV, and the likelihood of high compliance with the prophylactic regimen. The potential benefit of treating a sexually abused child should be weighed against the risk for adverse reactions. If antiretroviral PEP is being considered, a provider specializing in evaluating or treating HIV-infected children should be consulted.
