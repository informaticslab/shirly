 Treatment
</h2>
<p>
 PID treatment regimens must provide empiric, broad spectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Several antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic&nbsp;cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up. However, only a limited number of investigations have assessed and compared these regimens with regard to elimination of infection in the endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications (e.g., tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy) after antimicrobial&nbsp;regimens (389&ndash;391).
</p>
<p>
 All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper-reproductive-tract infection. The need to eradicate anaerobes from women who have PID has not been determined definitively. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the upper-reproductive tract of women who have PID, and data from in vitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides fragilis) can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. BV also is present in many women who have PID (383,391). Until treatment regimens that do not adequately cover these microbes have been demonstrated to prevent long-term sequelae&nbsp;(e.g., infertility and ectopic pregnancy) as successfully as&nbsp;the regimens that are effective against these microbes, the use of regimens with anaerobic activity should be considered. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made because prevention of long-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of appropriate antibiotics. When selecting a treatment regimen, health-care providers should consider availability, cost, patient acceptance, and antimicrobial susceptibility (392).
</p>
<p>
 In women with PID of mild or moderate clinical severity, outpatient therapy yields short- and long-term clinical outcomes&nbsp;similar to inpatient therapy. The decision of whether hospitalization is necessary should be based on the judgment of the provider and whether the patient meets any of the following&nbsp;suggested criteria:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be excluded;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; the patient is pregnant;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; the patient does not respond clinically to oral antimicrobial&nbsp;therapy;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; the patient is unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; the patient has severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or high fever; or
</p>
<p>
 &bull; the patient has a tubo-ovarian abscess.
</p>
<p>
 No evidence is available to suggest that adolescents benefit from hospitalization for treatment of PID. The decision to hospitalize adolescents with acute PID should be based on the same criteria used for older women. Younger women with mild-to-moderate acute PID have similar outcomes with either outpatient or inpatient therapy, and clinical response to outpatient&nbsp;treatment is similar among younger and older women.
