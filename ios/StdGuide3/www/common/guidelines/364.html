 Management of HBsAg-Positive Persons
</h4>
<p>
 This section provides recommendations for management of all HBsAg-positive persons. Additional recommendations for management of HBsAg-positive persons who are coinfected with HIV are available (130).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; All persons with HBsAg-positive laboratory results should be reported to the state or local health department.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; To verify the presence of chronic HBV infection, HBsAg-positive persons should be retested. The absence of IgM anti-HBc or the persistence of HBsAg for 6 months indicates chronic HBV infection.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a physician experienced in the management&nbsp;of CLD. Some patients with chronic hepatitis B will benefit from early intervention with antiviral treatment or screening to detect HCC at an early stage.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts of chronically&nbsp;infected persons should be identified. Unvaccinated sex partners and household and needle-sharing contacts should be tested for susceptibility to HBV infection (see Prevaccination Antibody Screening) and should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine immediately after collection of the blood sample for serologic testing. Susceptible persons should complete the vaccine series by using an age-appropriate vaccine dose and schedule.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons should be counseled&nbsp;to use latex condoms (448) to protect themselves from sexual exposure to infectious body fluids (e.g., semen and vaginal secretions), unless they have been demonstrated&nbsp;to be immune after vaccination (anti-HBs &ge;10 mIU/mL) or previously infected (anti-HBc positive).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; To prevent or reduce the risk for transmission to others, HBsAg-positive persons should be advised about the risk for transmission to household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts and the need for such contacts to receive hepatitis&nbsp;B vaccination. HBsAg-positive persons also should be advised to:
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; use methods (e.g., condoms) to protect nonimmune sex partners from acquiring HBV infection from sexual activity until the partner can be vaccinated and immunity documented;
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; cover cuts and skin lesions to prevent spread by infectious&nbsp;secretions or blood;
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; refrain from donating blood, plasma, body organs, other tissue, or semen; and
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; refrain from sharing household articles (e.g., toothbrushes,&nbsp;razors, or personal injection equipment) that could become contaminated with blood. In addition, HBsAg-positive persons should refrain from premasticating&nbsp;food provided to susceptible persons.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; To protect the liver from further harm, HBsAg-positive persons should be advised to:
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; avoid or limit alcohol consumption because of the effects of alcohol on the liver;
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; refrain from starting any new medicines, including OTC and herbal medicines, without checking with their health-care provider; and
</p>
<p>
 &ndash; obtain vaccination against hepatitis A if liver disease is determined to be present.
</p>
<p>
 When seeking medical or dental care, HBsAg-positive persons&nbsp;should be advised to inform their health-care providers of their HBsAg status so that they can be appropriately evaluated and managed. The following counseling messages should be considered for HBsAg-positive persons:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; HBV is not usually spread by hugging, coughing, food or water, sharing eating utensils or drinking glasses, or casual contact.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Persons should not be excluded from work, school, play, child care, or other settings because they are infected with HBV.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Involvement with a support group might help patients cope with chronic HBV infection.
