 Follow-Up
</h3>
<p>
 Except in pregnant women, test-of-cure (i.e., repeat testing 3&ndash;4 weeks after completing therapy) is not advised for persons treated with the recommended or alterative regimens, unless therapeutic compliance is in question, symptoms persist, or reinfection is suspected. Moreover, the validity of chlamydial diagnostic testing at &lt;3 weeks after completion of therapy (to identify patients who did not respond to therapy) has not been established. False-negative results might occur in the presence of persistent infections involving limited numbers of chlamydial organisms. In addition, NAAT conducted at &lt;3 weeks after completion of therapy in persons who were treated successfully could yield false-positive results because of the continued presence of nonviable organisms (197).

 A high prevalence of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 infection has been observed in women and men who were treated for chlamydial&nbsp;infection during the preceding several months (251,267,286&ndash; 288). Most post-treatment infections result from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner. Repeat infections confer an elevated risk for PID and other complications. Unlike the test-of-cure, which is not recommended, repeat
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 testing of recently infected women or men should be a priority for providers. Chlamydia-infected women and men should be retested approximately 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe that their sex partners were treated (251,267). If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next present for medical care in the 12 months following initial treatment.
