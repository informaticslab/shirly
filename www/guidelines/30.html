 Primary Prevention Recommendations
</h3>
<p>
 Primary prevention and anticipatory guidance to recognize symptoms and behaviors associated with STDs are strategies that can be incorporated into any or all types of health-care visits. The following recommendations for primary prevention of STDs (i.e., vaccination and counseling) are based on published federal agency and medical professional organizations&rsquo; clinical guidelines for sexually active adolescents:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; The HPV vaccine, either Cervarix or Gardasil, is recommended for 11 and 12 year-old females. The vaccine series can be started at 9 years of age. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for females aged 13&ndash;26 years who have not yet received or completed the vaccine series (16). The quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccine can also be used in males and females aged 9&ndash;26 years to prevent genital warts (17).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; The HBV vaccination series is recommended for all adolescents. Adolescents who have not previously received hepatitis B vaccine should be vaccinated routinely at any age with an appropriate dose and schedule (3,4).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; The HAV vaccination series for children and adolescents aged 2&ndash;18 years should be offered in areas with existing hepatitis A vaccination programs. In areas without existing hepatitis A vaccination programs, catch-up vaccination of unvaccinated children aged 2&ndash;18 years can be considered (2).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Information regarding HIV infection, testing, transmission, and implications of infection should be regarded as an essential component of the anticipatory guidance provided to all adolescents as part of health care (77).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Health-care providers who care for children and adolescents should integrate sexuality education into clinical practice. Providers should counsel adolescents about the sexual behaviors that are associated with risk for acquiring STDs and should educate patients using evidence-based prevention strategies, all of which include a discussion&nbsp;about abstinence and other risk-reduction behaviors (e.g., consistent and correct condom use). USPSTF recommends high-intensity behavioral counseling to prevent STIs* for all sexually active adolescents (6).
</p>
<p>
 * STI is the term used by USPSTF to describe the syndromes caused by various pathogens that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual activity.
